# The Green Software Foundation Oversight Committee

The Oversight Committee is made up of the Working Group chairs and Project Leads for active projects.

Whereas the Steering Committee (SC) is more focused on long term strategic direction of the Foundation the Oversight Committee is more focused on tactical, day to day aspects of running the Foundation.
