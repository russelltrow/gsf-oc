# Donating a Project

Donating a project to the Green Software Foundation (GSF) enables a collective governance model for a project maintained by one organization or individual. Donating a project might be a good approach if that increased governance is required to increase trust in the project. 

Our goal at the GSF is to build a trusted ecosystem. When we have a graduated project in our repository, we are giving the world confidence that they can trust that project, it has a community around it, it will be supported, and bugs will be resolved. They can use it in production.

Therefore, all donated projects should [meet the requirements](project-incubation-entry-considerations.md) of any other graduated project in the GSF.

A project can only be donated if there is a desire from the GSF members to maintain the project internally. So, to be accepted into the GSF, a project should have the following:

- A strong commitment from member organizations to support the donated project in the form of resources **specifically** allocated to work on that project. 
- A willingness on the part of the donor to **give up maintenance rights** on the project if they are not also a GSF member. Only members of the GSF can lead projects or have any form of meaningful permissions on GitHub.

The above points must be true to accept a project into the GSF.

Typically member organizations would donate their projects to the GSF. The organization continues to work on the project and commit resources to it; however, the governance moved to a collective rather than one organization that can help an open-source project evolve and give people more confidence.

There are other perhaps lighter-weight mechanisms of supporting external projects, endorsing them, co-promoting them, and collaborations that might be more suited than donations.
