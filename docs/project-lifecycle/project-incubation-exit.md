# Project Incubation Exit Criteria

## Introduction

Green Software Foundation has defined a [lifecycle](./project-lifecycle.md) for its projects but this definition does not specify in any detail what it takes for a project to be able to transition from the *Incubation* phase to the *Graduated* phase.

This document is meant to fill this gap by defining a set of criteria to be considered before moving a project from *Incubation* to *Graduated*.

It is important to note that *Graduated* in this case refers to the project itself rather than its product and it is therefore more about the maturity of process than the maturity of the product or General Availability (GA).

For this reason this document defines two sets of exit criteria. The first one is made of requirements expected to be met by all projects before moving to *Graduated*. The second set lists examples of additional requirements typically defined at the onset of the project as goals to be met to exit *Incubation*. These are expected to be documented in a [Proposal for a Green Software Foundation Project)](TODO) Because not all projects have the same goals, the importance of each criteria and the exact definition of this second set of criteria may vary from one project to another. Ultimately the OC is responsible for determining whether a project deserves to move to *Graduated* or not and this decision does not need to be solely based on these exit criteria. The purpose of these exit criteria is to help the OC in its decision process by informing its members of key aspects of the project.

# Minimum requirements

- Legal

    - All code has been made available under the appropriate License for this projects Working Group and is free of incompatible dependencies
    - Project name has been checked for trademark issues

- Community support

    - The project must have an active and diverse set of contributing members representing various constituencies
    - The project is not highly dependent on any single contributor (there are at least 3 legally independent committers and there is no single company or entity that is vital to the success of the project)
    - Release plans are developed and executed in public by the community.

- Project Management
  
    - The project has been assigned a GSF Project Manager.
    - The project has defined a set of Objectives and Key Results approved by the GSF Project Director. 
    - There is a clear understanding regarding who is responsible for tracking the progress of this project towards it's OKRs.
    - A project page with the required common details has been added to the GSF website. 

- Sufficient test coverage

    Where applicable, the project must include a comprehensive unit and integration test suite and document its coverage. Additional performance and scale test capability is desirable.

- Sufficient user documentation

    Where applicable, the project must including enough documentation for anyone to test or deploy any of the modules.

- Alignment

    - Requirements fulfillment

        The project must document what requirements and use cases it addresses.

    - Theory of Change

        The project must document how it fits within the [Green Software Foundation Theory Of Change](https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/theory-of-change-defining-strategy-gsf)

    - Compatibility with other Green Software Foundation projects

        Where applicable, the project should be compatible with other *Graduated* projects.

    - Release numbering: the project should use the Green Software Foundation standard [release taxonomy](./release-taxonomy.md), once that is agreed upon.

    - Project must make a [release](./release-taxonomy.md), even a "developer preview", before graduation.
  
- Infrastructure

    - Github repo has been created
    - Mailing lists have been created and are archived
    - Other communication means used, such as GitHub Discusssions, are set up
    - Where applicable, project is set up with Continuous Integration
    - All project repos have implemented the [common repository structure](./repository-structure.md)

- OpenSSF Best Practices Badge

    Where applicable, a team seeking to graduate from *Incubation* shall have started the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge application and be nearly complete with incomplete badge requirements referenced in their graduation proposal. That does not mean the project must have 100% of all criteria, just 100% of the applicable criteria. This is to allow for projects such as test harnesses, that have "N/A" answers for questions that don't offer that as an option.

# Additional considerations

In addition to the above, requirements such as the following may be defined at the onset of the project and considered as goals to be met to exit *Incubation*:

- Sufficient real world use

    The project should be used in real applications and not just in demos. Because not all real applications may be discussed publicly, in such cases statements providing as much details as possible should be made.

- Sufficient scalability

    Where applicable, the project must demonstrate sufficient scalability and document its scalability over various dimensions such as:

    - Maximum number of transactions per second
    - Maximum number of transactions per chain
    - Maximum size of a block

- Minimum test code coverage expected, such as, for example:

    - Minimum coverage for security & cryptography
    - Minimum coverage for other functionality
    - Minimum coverage for business logic/smart contract
